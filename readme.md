| Feature | Laravel 10.x | Django 5.x | Ruby on Rails 7.x | Comparison |
|---------|--------------|------------|-------------------|------------|
| **Founded** | 2011 by Taylor Otwell | 2005 by Adrian Holovaty and Simon Willison | 2004 by David Heinemeier Hansson | Rails is the oldest, followed by Django, then Laravel. Each has benefited from years of community contributions and refinement. |
| **Popularity (GH Stars)** | 77.5k+ | 77.9k+ | 55.3k+ | All three frameworks are widely adopted. |
| **Marketing & Community** | Active / Energetic / Strong | Silent / Calm  | Active  | The creators of Laravel and Rails leads the community while the creators of Django are silent in comparison |
| **Funding** | Sales of commercial products like Forge, Envoyer, Nova, and Spark, along with sponsorships and donations | donations and sponsorships from organizations and individuals who use and support the framework  | funded through the support of its parent company, Basecamp, and contributions from its community and sponsors  | Laravel has a solid funding mechanism, Rails also recieve active funded from 37Signals the company behind it, Django operates through donations |
| **Architecture** | MVC (Model-View-Controller) | MTV (Model-Template-View) | MVC (Model-View-Controller) | Laravel and Rails follow traditional MVC, while Django's MTV is similar but emphasizes templates. |
| **ORM** | Eloquent (Active Record pattern) | Django ORM (Data Mapper pattern) | Active Record | Eloquent and Rails' Active Record are similar, offering intuitive interfaces. Django's ORM provides more explicit query control. |
| **Database Migrations** | Artisan command-line tool | makemigrations and migrate commands | Rails migrations | Django's model-driven migrations enable automatic schema updates. Laravel and Rails offer powerful migration systems but require more manual input, while Django's approach often leads to faster development cycles. |
| **Routing** | Route definitions in separate files | URL patterns defined in app-level `urls.py` | Routes defined in `config/routes.rb` | Laravel and Rails centralize routing, while Django's approach aligns with its app-centric philosophy. |
| **Template Engine** | Blade | Django Template Language (DTL) | ERB (Embedded Ruby) | Blade and ERB allow language code within templates, offering flexibility. DTL is more restrictive but promotes better separation of concerns. |
| **Authentication** | Built-in, highly customizable | Built-in, with extensive options | Devise gem (commonly used) | All offer robust authentication. Laravel and Django provide built-in solutions, while Rails commonly uses Devise for enhanced features. |
| **API Development** | Laravel Sanctum for API auth | Django REST Framework (DRF) | Active Model Serializers | Sanctum focuses on simplicity, DRF is comprehensive, and Rails' solution is lightweight but extensible. |
| **Admin Interface** | No built-in admin (third-party packages available) | Built-in, customizable admin interface | No built-in admin (third-party gems available) | Django's admin interface is a standout feature, offering immediate productivity gains. Laravel and Rails rely on third-party solutions. |
| **Testing** | PHPUnit with Laravel-specific assertions | Django's test framework built on unittest | Minitest (default) or RSpec | All provide comprehensive testing tools. Rails' testing ecosystem is particularly rich with options like RSpec. |
| **Asynchronous Processing** | Queue system with various drivers | Celery (third-party) / Huey / django-tasks (a native tasks backend) is in development | Active Job with various backends | Laravel's queue system is well-integrated, Django doesnt really have an integrated solution, and Rails provides a unified API for background processing. |
| **Community and Ecosystem** | Large, active community with many packages | Large, active community with a focus on stability | Massive, mature community with a vast ecosystem of gems | All have strong communities. Rails has the advantage of maturity, while Laravel is known for rapid adoption of new features. |
| **Learning Curve** | Generally considered easier for beginners | Steeper initial learning curve, but powerful once mastered | "Convention over Configuration" makes it easy to start, but mastering Rails can take time | Laravel and Rails are often seen as more beginner-friendly, while Django's explicitness can be initially challenging but leads to a deeper understanding. |
| **Performance** | Good performance, with tools like Laravel Octane for optimization | Excellent performance, especially for data-heavy applications | Good performance, with recent versions focusing on improvements | All perform well when optimized. Django often edges out for database-intensive operations, but all have tools for performance enhancements. |
| **Scalability** | Scales well with proper architecture | Known for scaling to handle high traffic | Proven scalability with proper architecture | All can scale effectively. Django and Rails have more high-profile, high-traffic use cases demonstrating their scalability. |
| **Deployment Ease** | Easy deployment with Laravel Forge, Vapor, or traditional methods | Straightforward deployment to various platforms, with tools like Gunicorn and WSGI | Easy deployment with Heroku, Capistrano, or cloud platforms | Laravel offers managed services like Forge and Vapor for easy deployment. Django deployment is not as straightforward and takes sometime to figure out. Rails pioneered easy deployment with Heroku and has many established deployment patterns. |
